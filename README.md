There are numerous resources available for learning Python. Among YouTube channels, Code with Harry stands out as a top choice, particularly his Python playlist. FreeCodeCamp is another highly recommended channel with a comprehensive basic Python playlist.

For Windows 7 users, I recommend Python version 3.3. However, if you're on a system beyond Windows 7, you can opt for the latest 3.11.x version. During the Python installation, ensure to check the box that says "add to Path."

While using PyCharm, it's advisable not to overly organize by creating a new project for each file. Instead, consider making one project and utilizing different files within it. This approach can help save storage and streamline your work. Using Python you [APK Premium files.](https://modyhub.com/)
