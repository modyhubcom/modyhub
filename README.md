There are numerous resources available for learning Python. Among YouTube channels, Code with Harry stands out as a top choice, particularly his Python playlist. FreeCodeCamp is another highly recommended channel with a comprehensive basic Python playlist. Moving beyond YouTube, Udemy offers a plethora of free and paid courses, many of which come with certificates. Personally, I've amassed a collection of about a dozen Python courses on Udemy. For mobile learning, I favor [M1M0](https://modyhub.com/mimo-learn-coding-apk/) and Programming Hero as the best apps. Click the names to download them.

There are various options for executing code, both offline and online. For Android or iOS users, I highly recommend Pydroid3 as the top Python IDE. It offers a robust set of features, including an IDE, compiler, and a separate PIP window for easy package and module installation.

For laptop or PC users, online services might not be the best choice due to potential slowness and dependence on a stable internet connection. While VS Code is excellent, navigating its extensions and functionalities might be overwhelming for beginners. Instead, I strongly suggest PyCharm for a smoother experience.

To run PyCharm, you'll require both PyCharm itself and Python on your system.

For Windows 7 users, I recommend Python version 3.3. However, if you're on a system beyond Windows 7, you can opt for the latest 3.11.x version. During the Python installation, ensure to check the box that says "add to Path."

While using PyCharm, it's advisable not to overly organize by creating a new project for each file. Instead, consider making one project and utilizing different files within it. This approach can help save storage and streamline your work. Using Python you [APK Premium files.](https://modyhub.com/)

What are APK files?

An APK ([Android Package Kit](https://proapk.store/) file is the file format used for distributing and installing applications on Android devices. It's similar to an executable file (EXE) in Windows or a DMG file in macOS. APK files contain all the elements needed for an Android app to be installed on a device, including the app's code, resources, assets, manifest file, and certificates.

When you download an app from the Google Play Store, you're essentially downloading its APK file, which is then installed on your Android device. APK files can also be distributed and installed manually, bypassing the official app stores, though caution is advised as these files can potentially contain malware or pose security risks if obtained from unreliable sources.
